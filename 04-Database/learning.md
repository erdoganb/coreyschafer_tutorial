# i will write down the things i've learnt

## git
i've create a repo in github
tried to push a full project folder to it
then i failed!

So the problem was, i've add a README.md file while creating repo
when i tried to push items in my project got an error

I've realized that i need to fetch first.

### Lesson1: First pull the repo. Then push.
